## General info
Sami Room is a web application that mediates between renters and Sami Shamoon College of Engineering's students, allows bookings, sort the housing units by categories, manage everything related to finances, allow renters to be audited and more.
The rental is for the duration of the studies (or part-time) at attractive and subsidized prices for the students.

Motivation:
To allow access only for students of Sami Shmoon Beersheba and Ashdod campuses.
To enable registration and access only for students who present a valid student ID.
To provide a modern and easy to user interface for brokerage firms to manage their accounts.
To provide effective tracking of orders.
